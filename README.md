## Reflect Engine

### About
This is a kind of game engine designed to be a starting point of creating an mmorpg minecraft server. It is built on [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom), an open source library which allows to build minecraft servers with a lot of overhead using it's multithreading support.

This should have all of the neccesary libraries in order to build an entertaining and interesant server. Players won't need a mod to play (a client side mod could also be created for more indepth gameplay).
